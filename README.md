# SIEM
Security Information Management System
Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions collect logs and analyze security events along with other data to speed threat detection and support security incident and event management, as well as compliance.
Essentially, a SIEM technology system collects data from multiple sources, enabling faster incident response to threats. If an anomaly is detected, it might collect more information, trigger an alert, or quarantine an asset.

Complex Threat Landscape: The rise of complex and frequent cyber threats (e.g., ransomware, insider threats) requires robust monitoring and response.
Challenges in Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often generate numerous alerts, leading to alert fatigue and missed threats.
Need for Centralized Monitoring: Organizations struggle with fragmented security data across various tools, creating blind spots in threat detection.

Data Collection and Integration: Aggregate data from various sources, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, servers, and applications.
Event Correlation: Use correlation rules to identify potential threats by analyzing relationships between different events.
Alert Prioritization and Management: Classify and prioritize alerts based on threat level to avoid alert fatigue.
Automation and Orchestration: Implement automated responses for certain types of threats and use workflows to streamline incident management.
Analysis and Reporting: Regularly analyze collected data for trends and generate reports to meet compliance standards.
